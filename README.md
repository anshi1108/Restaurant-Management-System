This Python project is a simple restaurant management system (RMS) designed to take orders, display a menu, process payments, and manage receipts. The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using the Tkinter library.

## User Requirements

### User Requirement Document

The user requirement document for this project is utilized to gather essential information such as the restaurant name and menu details.

### Format and Entry Order

When updating or entering data into the UserRequirementDocument.txt file, please follow this format and order:

1. **Restaurant Name:** Enter the name of the restaurant at the beginning of the document.
2. **Menu Items and Prices:** List the menu items and their corresponding prices in two separate sections. The menu items and prices should align in their respective sections. Each item or price should be on a separate line.
